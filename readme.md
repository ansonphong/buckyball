# üìêüõ†Ô∏è BUILDING PHONG BUCKY BALL
### Comprehensive Building Plan for a 5/8 Truncated Icosahedron Buckyball Structure

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to construct a 5/8 truncated icosahedron (buckyball) using 4x4x10 cedar posts for framing. Each face of the buckyball will be either a hexagon, pentagon, or half-hexagon, built as independent panels that slot together. The hexagons have an edge-to-edge width of 8 feet, resulting in a structure approximately 22.89 feet in diameter.

## 3. Cut Instructions

Each edge piece requires three specific cuts on each end to achieve the correct angles for assembly.

### Edge Length Calculation

- **Edge Length**: 5 feet (to fit within 8 ft edge-to-edge hexagon)

### Cuts on Each End of the 4x4x5 ft Sections

#### For Hexagons:

1. **Miter Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 30 degrees
   - **Direction**: Miter saw set to 30 degrees horizontally
   - **Purpose**: Allows edges to meet at the correct angle when forming the hexagon

2. **Bevel Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 0 degrees (no bevel required for hexagons)
   - **Direction**: Saw blade remains vertical

3. **Rip Cut**:
   - **Angle**: Approximately 19.1 degrees
   - **Direction**: Cut along the thickness of the 4x4 to create the correct face angle
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the face of the 4x4 aligns flush with the plane of the hexagon

#### For Pentagons:

1. **Miter Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 36 degrees
   - **Direction**: Miter saw set to 36 degrees horizontally

2. **Bevel Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 0 degrees (no bevel required for pentagons)

3. **Rip Cut**:
   - **Angle**: Approximately 18 degrees
   - **Direction**: Similar to hexagons, adjust for pentagon geometry

#### For Half-Hexagons:

1. **Miter Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 30 degrees on the connected ends, 90 degrees on the open ends
   - **Direction**: Adjust miter saw accordingly

2. **Bevel Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 0 degrees

3. **Rip Cut**:
   - **Angle**: 19.1 degrees on connected ends, none on open ends

### Detailed Cutting Steps

1. **Measure and Mark**:
   - Cut 5-foot sections from the 10-foot posts.
   - Mark the miter angles on each end.

2. **Set Up Miter Saw**:
   - Adjust miter angle to required degrees for hexagons (30¬∞) or pentagons (36¬∞).

3. **Perform Miter Cuts**:
   - Cut both ends of each piece with the appropriate miter angle.

4. **Set Up Table Saw for Rip Cuts**:
   - Tilt the blade to the required rip angle (19.1¬∞ for hexagons, 18¬∞ for pentagons).
   - Adjust the fence to ensure the cut removes material from the correct face.

5. **Perform Rip Cuts**:
   - Rip along the length of the edge to create the face angle.

6. **Label Each Piece**:
   - Mark pieces according to their shape (H for hexagon, P for pentagon).

### Notes:

- **Accuracy is Critical**: Use an angle finder to verify saw settings.
- **Test Fit**: Before mass production, cut one of each type and test the fit.

## 4. Assembly Instructions

### Assembling Hexagons

1. **Layout**:
   - Arrange six edge pieces in a hexagonal shape on a flat surface.

2. **Drilling Holes**:
   - **Bolt Holes**: Drill 1/2-inch holes 2 inches from each end, centered on the face.
   - **Countersink**: Optional countersinking for bolt heads for a flush finish.

3. **Bolting Together**:
   - Insert bolts through the aligned holes.
   - Place washers on both sides.
   - Secure with nuts but do not fully tighten.

4. **Alignment**:
   - Adjust edges to ensure the hexagon is flat and the joints are tight.

5. **Tightening**:
   - Once aligned, tighten bolts in a star pattern to distribute tension evenly.

### Assembling Pentagons

- **Follow the same steps** as hexagons, adjusting for five edges and 36-degree miter cuts.

### Assembling Half-Hexagons

1. **Layout**:
   - Arrange four edge pieces to form a half-hexagon (three connected sides with one open side).

2. **Assembly**:
   - Follow similar drilling and bolting procedures.

### Best Practices

- **Pre-Drill Holes**: Reduces the risk of splitting the wood.
- **Use Clamps**: Hold pieces firmly during drilling and assembly.
- **Check for Square**: Ensure angles are accurate before tightening.

## 5. Surface Panel Installation

### Preparing Plywood Panels

1. **Cutting Panels**:
   - Use the assembled frames as templates.
   - Place plywood over the frame and mark the outline.

2. **Cutting Shapes**:
   - Use a circular saw or jigsaw to cut along the marked lines.

3. **Sanding Edges**:
   - Smooth edges for a clean fit.

### Attaching Panels

1. **Positioning**:
   - Lay the cut plywood panel over the frame.

2. **Securing**:
   - Use exterior-grade wood screws.
   - Screw into the 4x4 edges every 12 inches.

3. **Avoiding Gaps**:
   - Ensure panels are flush with the edges.
   - Use clamps to hold panels tight during screwing.

### Best Practices

- **Seal Edges**: Apply a sealant to plywood edges to prevent moisture ingress.
- **Pilot Holes**: Pre-drill screw holes to prevent splitting.

## 6. Reinforcement Techniques

### Using Scrap Cedar

- **Corner Blocks**:
  - Cut triangular blocks from scrap cedar.
  - Attach at joints on the inside corners using wood screws and wood glue.

### Japanese Wood Joinery Techniques

1. **Mortise and Tenon Joints**:
   - **Application**: Strengthen connections between edges.
   - **Method**:
     - Cut a mortise (hole) into one piece.
     - Cut a tenon (protrusion) on the mating piece.
     - Fit together with wood glue.

2. **Lap Joints**:
   - **Application**: Overlapping joints for added surface area.
   - **Method**:
     - Remove half the thickness from each piece at the joint.
     - Pieces overlap flush.

### Western Construction Practices

- **Metal Brackets**:
  - Use galvanized steel brackets at high-stress joints.
  - Secure with wood screws.

### Best Practices for Corner Reinforcements

- **Focus on High-Stress Areas**:
  - Base connections.
  - Points where multiple panels meet.

- **Use Quality Adhesives**:
  - Exterior-grade wood glue enhances joint strength.

- **Regular Inspection**:
  - Check joints periodically for signs of wear or movement.

## 7. Final Structural Notes

- **Assembly Sequence**:
  - Start from the base and work upwards.
  - Assemble pentagons and hexagons separately before connecting.

- **Connecting Panels**:
  - Use bolts to join panels together at shared edges.
  - Ensure bolt holes are aligned across panels.

- **Leveling the Structure**:
  - Use a level at each stage.
  - Adjust as necessary to maintain balance.

- **Flat Bottom Surface**:
  - Ensure the base pentagons and hexagons are aligned to create a flat bottom.
  - May require trimming the bottom edges of base panels.

- **Final Tightening**:
  - After full assembly, go back and retighten all bolts.

## 8. Size Calculations

### Edge Length Confirmation

- **Edge-to-Edge Width of Hexagon (h)**: 8 ft
- **Edge Length (s)**:
  - \( h = 2s \times \cos(30^\circ) \)
  - \( s = \frac{h}{2 \times \cos(30^\circ)} \)
  - \( s = \frac{8}{2 \times 0.866} \approx 4.6188 \text{ ft} \)

### Diameter of the Structure

1. **Circumradius (R)**:
   - \( R = a \times \frac{\sqrt{58 + 18\sqrt{5}}}{4} \)
   - \( a = 4.6188 \text{ ft} \)
   - \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.2361 \)
   - \( \sqrt{58 + 18 \times 2.2361} \approx 9.9124 \)
   - \( R = 4.6188 \times \frac{9.9124}{4} \approx 11.444 \text{ ft} \)

2. **Diameter (D)**:
   - \( D = 2R \)
   - \( D = 2 \times 11.444 \approx 22.888 \text{ ft} \)

**Conclusion**: The buckyball structure will have a diameter of approximately **22.89 feet**.
